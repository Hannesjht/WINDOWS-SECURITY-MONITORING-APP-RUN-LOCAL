Quick Fix Checklist:

Run through this checklist:

1. [ ] Is the JAR file in the same directory?

2. [ ] Does the JAR have the correct main class? 
   Test with: `java -jar ai-security-2.0.0.jar`
   
3. [ ] Is Java installed? Test with: `java -version`

4. [ ] Are you using simple JRE version (1.8.0 not 17)?

5. [ ] Are error messages very short (under 50 chars)?


Manual GUI Method:


If XML keeps failing, use the GUI:

1. Open Launch4j

2. Basic Tab:

   - Output file: `C:\your\path\AI Security Monitor.exe`
   
   - Jar: `C:\your\path\ai-security-2.0.0.jar`
   
   - ☐ Don't wrap the jar (unchecked)
   
   - Header type: `gui`

3. Classpath Tab:

   - Main class: `com.security.Main`
   
   - Click "Add" and select your JAR

4. JRE Tab:

   - Min JRE version: `1.8.0`
   
   - Max JRE version: (leave empty)
   
   - Initial heap size: `256`
   
   - Max heap size: `512`

5. Click "Build wrapper"


The "Enter free form" error is almost always an XML formatting issue. 

Start with the simplest possible XML (one line, no extra tags) and gradually add features until it breaks, 
then you'll know what's causing it.


1. Understanding JRE Path Options in Launch4j GUI:

In the Launch4j GUI, you have two different fields for JRE:


Option 1: "Bundled JRE path":

This is for inside the EXE (embedded JRE):

- Path relative to EXE where JRE is located

- Example: `.\jre` means there's a `jre` folder next to the EXE

- Use this if you're distributing Java with your app


Option 2: "JRE paths" (text area below):

This is for external JRE locations (search order):


.\jre
%JAVA_HOME%
%PATH%
registry
```

This searches in order:

1. `.\jre` folder next to EXE

2. `JAVA_HOME` environment variable

3. `PATH` environment variable

4. Windows registry


Recommendation: Use this in the text area:


.\jre
%JAVA_HOME%
registry
```


2. Error Messages in GUI:

To add the XML error messages to the GUI:

1. Go to "Messages" tab in Launch4j GUI

2. Copy these into the fields:


Startup error: An error occurred while starting the application.

JRE not found error: Java Runtime Environment not found!

This application requires Java 17 or later.

Please install Java from:
https://adoptium.net/temurin/releases/

Then restart the application.


JRE version error: This application requires Java 17 or later.

Please update your Java installation from:
https://adoptium.net/temurin/releases/


Launcher error: The launcher was unable to create the application.


Note: Keep messages shorter than 1024 characters total for all messages combined.
