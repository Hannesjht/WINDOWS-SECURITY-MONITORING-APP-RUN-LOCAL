Launch4j....................

Download the latest version from: http://launch4j.sourceforge.net/

Prepare project Files:

Create the folder structure:

C:\Users\path\AI-Security-Exe\
├── ai-security-2.0.0.jar     # Your main JAR file
├── icon.ico                  # Application icon (optional)
├── jre\                      # Optional: embedded JRE
└── config.xml                # Launch4j configuration
```

Create an Application Icon:

You can create an .ico file using:

Or use a PowerShell command to create a basic icon:

# Save this as create-icon.ps1 and run it:

Add-Type -AssemblyName System.Drawing
# Create a simple icon (shield + network)
$bitmap = New-Object System.Drawing.Bitmap(256, 256)
$graphics = [System.Drawing.Graphics]::FromImage($bitmap)

# Draw background
$graphics.Clear([System.Drawing.Color]::FromArgb(30, 30, 46))

# Draw shield
$shieldBrush = New-Object System.Drawing.SolidBrush([System.Drawing.Color]::FromArgb(46, 204, 113))
$graphics.FillEllipse($shieldBrush, 50, 50, 156, 156)

# Draw network lines
$pen = New-Object System.Drawing.Pen([System.Drawing.Color]::White, 8)
$graphics.DrawLine($pen, 128, 70, 128, 186)
$graphics.DrawLine($pen, 70, 128, 186, 128)
$graphics.DrawEllipse($pen, 70, 70, 116, 116)

# Save as ICO
$iconStream = New-Object System.IO.MemoryStream
$bitmap.Save($iconStream, [System.Drawing.Imaging.ImageFormat]::Png)
$icon = [System.Drawing.Icon]::FromHandle(([System.Drawing.Bitmap]::FromStream($iconStream)).GetHicon())
$iconStream.Dispose()

# Save to file
$iconStream2 = New-Object System.IO.MemoryStream
$icon.Save($iconStream2)
[System.IO.File]::WriteAllBytes("icon.ico", $iconStream2.ToArray())
$iconStream2.Dispose()

Write-Host "Created icon.ico" -ForegroundColor Green
```

Or download a pre-made icon from:

- https://www.iconarchive.com/ (search "security shield")

- https://www.flaticon.com/ (free icons)


Or create an Launch4j Configuration File:

Create `config.xml` in your folder:

Manually add info and save settings as .xml.

6. Building the .EXE:

Method A: Using GUI

Fill in all tabs as above

Click the Build wrapper button (gear icon)

Wait for "Building finished successfully" message

Your .exe is now in the output directory



Step 1: Rename the JRE Folder: ( `jdk-17.0.17+10-jre` )

The folder should be exactly named   `jre`   (not `jdk-17.0.17+10-jre`):

1. Go to: `C:\Users\path\`

2. The structure should be:

For final distribution, create this Portable Distribution Structure:

AI Security Monitor (Portable)/

+-- AI Security Monitor.exe    # Launch4j executable
+-- ai-security-2.0.0.jar      # Your app
+-- jre/                       # Java runtime (rename your folder to this)
¦   +-- bin/
¦   ¦   +-- java.exe
¦   ¦   +-- ...
¦   +-- lib/
+-- splash.bmp                 # Optional splash
+-- icon.ico                   # App icon
+-- logs/                      # Auto-created
+-- launch.bat                 # Backup launcher
+-- README.txt                 # Instructions
```


2. Extract to your folder:
   
C:\Users\path\AI-Security-Exe\jre\
  
  
3. In Launch4j JRE tab:
   
JRE path: jre
   
Bundled JRE path: .\jre
